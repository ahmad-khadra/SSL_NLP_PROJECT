Since I couldn't get a free API for the financial news and historical data, it's easier for you to run the notebooks where I got and processed some data ('Prediction_Regression' and 'Prediction_Classification' notebooks)
All you have to do is to open the notebooks on a platform (I'd recommend Google Colab). Then upload the necessary files ('LDA_Bagging' for the regression and 'cnn_lstm_2010_news.keras' & 'FinaData_2010.csv' for the classification). Finally run all the cells and it should work fine.
